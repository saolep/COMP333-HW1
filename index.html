                <h2>Rate your favorite songs</h2>
                <p>For any given song you can rate it on a scale of 1 to 10. As well as assign it a more general thumbs up or thumbs down.
                    If that does not sound like a detailed enough evaluation of a song, you can also write a short 250 character blurb containing your thoughts.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature">
                    <h2>Add your own music</h2>
                    <p>If you cannot find the songs you want to rate on MusiScope already, you can input them into our system yourself. 
                       You can even add an entire list of songs automatically and then rate individual songs at your leisure.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature">
                    <h2>See what your friends have rated</h2>
                    <p>MusiScope allows you to look across other peoples reviews and accounts. 
                       That way you can see what your friends and enemies have to say about your favorite songs. 
                       You can also add friends to be updated on what music they are listening to</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature">
                    <h2>Share your thoughts on Artists, Albums, or Songs</h2>
                    <p>If you have thoughts on a new album, artist, or song you can do more than just a simple rating. 
                       MusiScope lets you write blog posts to share your thoughts with the world in a longer form than what a single review would allow.</p>

                   The feature descriptions given above are not 100% accurate, and contain some exaggerations of the capabilities of the project.
